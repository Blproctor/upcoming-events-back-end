# Capstone Project

## Upcoming Events App

The Upcoming Events app functions as a single page application using HTML and CSS for styling. The [client side](https://github.com/Blproctor/weekly-events-front-end) is written in Javascript with the jQuery library and Handlebars templating. The back end is written utilizing Express Mongoose and a MongoDB database.

The back end was deployed on [Heroku](https://protected-hamlet-58469.herokuapp.com/).
